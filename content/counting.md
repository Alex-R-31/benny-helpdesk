## What is the Counting?

The Counting is a fun module for your users to interact and have fun with one another. It can be fast paced or slow paced depending if you enabled spam filter.


## How to setup counting and edit it's components.

Firstly select a channel within your server that benny can see, look at troubleshooting to see if you have the correct permissions set!

Secondly select allow text or if you wish for a user not to be able to add texts after the numbers make sure the button is grey not green, what i call the spam filter is repeated counting if this is enabled a user can count as many times as they want in a row with it is disabled they have to wait until another user counts. If you don't want people editing messages to prevent counting being a mess enable counting report this will delete the users message and repost the number they counted to. If you wish to make challenges for your members set a pin interval so for example if it is set to 100 every one hundreth number like 100, 200, 300 etc it will pin.
