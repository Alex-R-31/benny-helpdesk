## What is the Music Quiz?

The Music Quiz is a fun module for your users to interact and have fun with one another. It can be fast paced and challenging but that is what makes it fun. To use the music quiz, you can type `Benny start-quiz` while in a voice channel. It will join, and start the quiz after 5 seconds. Anyone in the voice channel may participate in the quiz, by typing the name of the song, or the name of the artist in the channel that the command was originally used in.

You earn 1 point for getting the title of the song correct, 1 point for getting the author of the song correct, or 3 points for both. You have 30 seconds for each song. As soon as a user has guessed the title and artist of a song, nobody else can earn points for guessing it. This ensures that it's a competitive race between users!

We currently support the following genres, each with 100-250 songs, and aim to add more soon:
- metal
- pop

To stop the quiz, simply run `Benny stop-quiz`, or wait until the 15 songs have finished playing.
