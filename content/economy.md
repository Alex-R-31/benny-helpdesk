## What is the Economy?

The economy module is a module where users in the server can use their money/coins to buy roles that give they speical recogintion or abilities depending what you setup within discord (not to do with benny)

Commands and what they do and how to set them up!

<ins>**Baltop:**</ins> This command is used in order to see who is the current richest user in the server<br>
<ins>**Buy:** This links with the roleshop and lets you buy roles from the shop<br>
<ins>**Coins:**</ins> Shows your current balance<br>
<ins>**Daily:**</ins> gives you 100 every 24hrs (this command is on global cooldown so make sure you are using it in the server you really want to gain money on)<br>
<ins>**Gamble:**</ins> you can gamble between 5-500 the percentages of winning are depenant as the bot rolls a number between 1-100 if greater than 90 you win big money. If greater than 70 you win normal ammount otherwise you lose if less than 70.<br>
<ins>**Getworkers:**</ins> workers help you get money if you forget to use a command or away from discord for a long period of time or just there to gain more money on the side. You can only get up to 3 workers and they all give 10 coins a hour so if you had all three you can get 30 coins per hour (at the moment workers are not working there is no eta as of when they will work again just be patient)<br>
<ins>**Pay:**</ins> Pay a user your coins by doing pay '@user' 'ammount' <br>
<ins>**Payrandom:**</ins> Pays a random user in the server you coins by doing payrandom 'ammount'<br>
<ins>**Roleshop:**</ins> Shows you whats currently availble in the shop (not available at the moment, no eta when fixed) <br>
<ins>**Russianroulette:**</ins> Use at your own risk high risk low gain, you have a 1/4 chance of losing!<br>
