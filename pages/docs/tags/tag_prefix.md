A tag prefix can be used to speed up the amount of time it takes to send a tag. For example, instead of sending `!tag ExampleTag` you can use `?ExampleTag`, just like seen here: ![TagPrefix](/docs/tags/tag_prefix.jpg)
<Alert style="info">Note: You can setup your tag prefix on your dashboard in the tags module.</Alert>
