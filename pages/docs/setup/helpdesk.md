# What is the Wizard Helpdesk?
The Wizard Helpdesk channel is a channel that Wizard inserts into your server (by your request) to allow you to speak with Wizard Staff without having to join the support server.

<Alert style="destructive">
    Do <b>NOT</b> abuse this system. By abusing it, you will get your server blacklisted from using it.
</Alert>

## When should I use the Wizard Helpdesk channel?
You should use the Wizard Helpdesk channel only when you have a quick bug report, or a problem you think could be solved easily.

### What if I think this *isn't* quick?
You may join our [support server](https://discord.gg/Sq5feYC) instead.

## How do I use the Wizard Helpdesk channel?
### Creating the Channel
You can start it up by going to your dashboard (the button at the top right of this page). Select your server, and under the `Settings` tab, there will be a section about it at the top. Click **Create Helpdesk Channel** to create it.

If it doesn't exist, Wizard will create a category named **Wizard Channels** (this stores all channels Wizard creates) and then put the channel under it.

### Using the Channel
You can begin to type your message in the Wizard Helpdesk channel. Be sure that your message is **over 150 characters** in order for it to be sent.

> **Note:** You will receive the same support as you would in the support server. Any staff member may respond, anonymously or not.

#### The option is disabled.
If the Create Helpdesk Channel button is disabled, it means that it already exists. Check your server for a category named **Wizard Channels**. If you really can't find it, you may join our [support server](https://discord.gg/Sq5feYC) instead.
